<li data-id="playthrough_0_1" class="f_other">When you gain control of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a>, head west to use the nearby door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_2" class="f_other">Head west down the hallway. You find the first zombie munching on your friend, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J. Sullivan</a>. Back off as the zombie comes after you, and go back to the dining room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_3" class="f_other">Head east and use the double doors at the end.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_4" class="f_item">After the cutscene, you'll see that everyone's gone. Go pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_(remake)">Handgun</a>. <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> only has 6 spaces in his inventory, so you'll have to use the item boxes more than with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill Valentine</a>, and he also doesn't get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade_Launcher_(RE1)">Grenade Launcher</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_5" class="f_item">Head back to where you found <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J. Sullivan</a>. If you check him, you'll get a video tape you can watch later in the game. Keep going, and head through the door. Go to the birdcage and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> (Easy/Normal mode), and then head by the stairs to find two <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a>. Climb the stairs and enter the door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_6" class="f_item">Have your weapon ready, but don't worry about the zombie in front of you lying down, he won't be back...yet. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a> by it (2 on Easy). Round the corner and keep going, being sure to watch out for the zombie by the second door. Dodge or kill him, and go down the hall of spears. Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> in front of the mirror, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Arrow">Golden Arrow</a> near it. Examine it and just get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arrowhead">Arrowhead</a>. There will be another zombie around the corner (Normal/Hard modes), so watch out for it. Go through the only door you can, the one on the right, once you reach the end of the hall. You'll end up on the dining room balcony, and a zombie will be on the far end of the balcony. Also on the far end of the balcony is a statue holding a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Gemstone">Blue Gemstone</a>. Push it to the open rail and then off the balcony's edge so it breaks on the floor below you. Don't worry about heading back down for it just yet.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_7" class="f_item">Go to your right (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield's</a> left) and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> (Easy/Normal modes). Head back into the Main Hall and then go through the door in the middle of the room. Watch out for a zombie, and one that's easy to dodge (it barely even comes out), if you're playing on Normal/Hard modes. There are no zombies here on Easy. Go down the steps and turn left by the gate (which you can't open yet). Head to the end and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arrowhead">Arrowhead</a> on the stone. Head down the long staircase and come toward the camera. Go under the coffin and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Curses">Book Of Curses</a>. Examine the back of it to get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_8" class="f_item">Return to the Main Hall, and take the stairs to the upper west side of this room (above door from the dining room) there are double doors, proceed through them. Avoid the zombie and you need to go into the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a> locked door farthest down the right.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_9" class="f_item">There are two zombies in the room, one coming up from the stairs and the other around the corner past the stairs. Don't go through the first door you see, although you can unlock it now. You'll notice a zombie on the floor after heading down the stairs, and it'll be back if you don't dispose of it. For now, don't worry about it. Enter the door next to the body and you'll be in a Safe Room. Deposit whatever you don't need, but be sure to keep your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_(remake)">Handgun</a> and some ammo and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>. Come back out the Safe Room and go the way you haven't gone yet. There are 2 doors, both locked. You'll need an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> to open the door on the right, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Key">Armor Key</a> to open the one at the end of the hall. Do yourself a favor and unlock the door at the end of the hall on the top of the stairs for a shorter path.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_10" class="f_item"><font color="red" style="font-family: Georgia;">WARNING</font>: Do not exit this room back to the main hall as this will cause <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a> to hand you <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Shells">Acid Shells</a>, making the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> inaccessible later on in this guide. Head through the door locked by the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a> to your left.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_11" class="f_item">Go back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main room, and this time head through the double doors on the east side. There's really no point of going into the space on the other side of cabinet, unless you have a closet key. Push the drawer next to the statue and climb up to get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_1ST_FLOOR">Map Of The 1F</a>. Push the drawer next to the hole in the wall and then go through it to get a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>. A zombie will appear when you head back so avoid him and push the drawer to block the area out so he can't get you. So just go through the other door and walk until the glass cracks a bit. Then push the shelf and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>. Continue down the hall around the other corner and move another cabinet to get a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> (Easy/Normal modes). Go through the next door and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> will be looking at you.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_12" class="f_other"><font color="red" style="font-family: Georgia;">WARNING</font>: If you go back through the hallway, the dogs will jump in and attack you. They will only attack if you go back through the hallway while they won't attack if you head through the hallway from the map statue room.)</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_13" class="f_item">Go back and head into the next door, which leads into a bathroom. Drain the tub, and a zombie will come after <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a>. After the scene, kill it. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> from the bath and leave the room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_14" class="f_item">Now you can unlock the door by the one you entered by. Go all the way down, turn and find the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a> in a wheel barrel. To the right are a couple <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a>. Then go back and go through the door on the far left of the room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_15" class="f_item">There will be a zombie all the way down and around the corner, so don't worry about him yet. Instead, go through the first door you see, on the left. Run down until you start climbing up the stairs, because there is a zombie by them, and if you run you can dodge it. Get it to start climbing, and shoot it down. After you reach the very top of the stairs, there will be another zombie around the corner that you can't see because of the camera angle. Also, there's another one if you didn't see it at the very end of the long hall (not on Easy). If you kill them, try to have them all die on top of each other for later. Now go back down the stairs after killing the zombies, and enter the Safe Room after picking up what's next to the stairs (Easy).</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_16" class="f_item">Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Spray">First Aid Spray</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbons</a>. There is also a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> on the small table with the lantern on Easy mode. Pick up the other item in here, the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a>. It's empty so go up to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kerosene">Kerosene</a> Canister. Each <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kerosene">Kerosene</a> Canister has 4 units of fuel (Normal/Hard) and 6 on Easy. You can put away the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Knife_(RE1)">Combat Knife</a> if you haven't already, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a>. Take a health item if you wish, and take the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> from the typewriter. Make sure to have at least 3 inventory spaces free, and my advice would be to not carry any health because you'll be coming up on some more, just make sure to be on Fine. Now go and burn the zombie corpses.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_17" class="f_item">Head back up the stairs and come towards the camera. Go down the short hall and enter the door, preparing for a zombie attack (Normal/Hard). When you're through, there will be a zombie in the way of where you need to go. Avoid it or kill it, just run to the other end of the hallway and past the other zombie and into the main hall. Go into the hallway where you saw the first zombie in the game and then go down the stairs and unlock the door and discard the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>. Get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> in the kitchen along with anything else. A zombie is on the floor and another will come from above when you try to leave so avoid them and run up the stairs. Head back through the dining room to the main hall and then go through the upper floor dining room and then into the stair room with the safe room at the bottom.</li>

Head back through the dining room to the main hall and then go through the upper floor dining room and then into the stair room with the safe room at the bottom.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_18" class="f_item">Unlock the door with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> here. Remember the locked doors back near the Medical Supply Save Room? Go back there and head through the door at the end of the hall. Burn the corpse of the zombie on the ground near the safe room as well. Use the other <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> to open the door and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Grenade_(RE1)">Flash Grenade</a>, and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbons</a> in the desk drawer. Deposit whatever you don't need into the item box while keeping the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a> and a space open.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_19" class="f_item">Head back across the main hall, through the double doors, through the hall with the cracked window, and into the next hall through another door. At the end of the hall go through the door into the small room. Go in the single door to the right and enter the other room. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> and replace the <a href="">Pump-action Shotgun with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a> or else you'll get crushed in the next room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_20" class="f_item">Go back into the stair room nearby and then deposit any unnecessary items in the item box to leave at least 2 spaces open. Go up and into the upper hallway. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wooden_Mount">Wooden Mount</a> on the lamp shelf and either avoid or kill the nearby zombie and get to the room nearby. Head to the chessboard and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a>, and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_Whistle">Dog Whistle</a> near it. Go through the door you didn't come in through.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_21" class="f_item">After you're finished making sure the zombies aren't coming back, head back through the door at the end of the hall. Light the fire place with your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lighter_(RE1)">Lighter</a> and then place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wooden_Mount">Wooden Mount</a> on top of it and you'll get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_2ND_FLOOR">Map Of The 2F</a>. Also take any <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> in the room. Head back through the upper hall and then run around to where the Safe Room is on the West Side and go through the door opened with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_22" class="f_item">You're outside now. Now position yourself so that you're ready for a dog attack. The best place is right by the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a> growing nearby. As I recommended, you should use your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> here. Now go ahead and use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_Whistle">Dog Whistle</a>. Wait for the dogs to come, and shoot them when they get close for maximum damage. There are only two dogs, one of which has what you need. Pick the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Collar">Collar</a> and examine it. You will find something you need to flip or push. Then examine it again and you'll get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Imitation_of_a_key">Imitation Of A Key</a> (you'll have to rotate it a bit).

<li data-id="playthrough_0_23" class="f_item">Now, go back and down into the Safe Room. Go ahead and put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_(remake)">Handgun</a> away.

Just run past it and when he gets up just shoot him up with your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> in the head. If you don't, keep shooting him until he's dead. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a> if you're hurt if you didn't already take it last time you were here. There are no enemies in here, so don't get tense. Just a simple death trap. Keep walking until you find the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Key">Armor Key</a> on the floor. Take and replace it with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Imitation_of_a_key">Imitation Of A Key</a>, and now head back to the dining room. </li>

Now head to the room to your right. There's a zombie on the floor and another in the closet. See if you can burn the zombie on the ground first and then kill the closet zombie to get an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Key_(Remake)">Old Key</a> and take anything else in the room.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_28" class="f_item">Turn right after you get back. Enter the door on the same side as the one you just came in from.

If you don't hear anything, continue forward and enter the first door to <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield's</a> right.

There'll be a zombie in the corridor where you have to turn. After putting him down, enter the room inside the dark hall. You'll be in a small room. You need to light the candles on the table. Check around the room for some ammo. After you've lit the room, push the shelf down on the right side, toward the camera rather than away. Not the one where you found ammo. After you push it, go into it, or it could be safer to back up into it, because there will be a zombie when the angle changes. Run out and around the table and avoid the zombie. Go back into the little opening and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Musical_Score">Musical Score</a>Musical Score. Now leave this room, and go back through the room with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a>.

You'll find yourself in a room with a stuffed animal's head.

There is a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Grenade_(RE1)">Flash Grenade</a> on the table. Pick it up. Now run straight, past the windows, until you see a door in the end. Open it and go inside. Put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a> in the water pump and turn the handle to red. The water will kill the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Plant">Monster Plant</a>. Also, there are 5 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a>.

The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a> is in the back, past the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a>. Now run back out, and 2 zombies will crash through the window. Run away, because you don't need to be back in this room for a while. Head towards the bottom part of the "F" shaped of the room. There are two doors--one on the wall and the other door at the end. Go into the door at the end.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_34" class="f_item">You're in the hall where <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J. Sullivan</a> was killed around the corner.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_35" class="f_item">Inside that room is a piano.

After that time, come back and she'll be better. The wall will move, and you have to go in the secret passage. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Emblem">Gold Emblem</a> (there's also part of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Trevor%27s_diary">Trevor's Diary</a>), replace it with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Emblem">Wooden Emblem</a>, run back to the dining room, put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Emblem">Gold Emblem</a> above the fireplace.

Walk up the steps and unlock the door and discard the key. Walk a little toward the back and the big snake, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a>, tries to eat ya. Now just keep avoiding the snake, and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a> on the other side of the room, and there's some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a> here as well (Easy mode), but all you really need to the third <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a>.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_37" class="f_item">If you were poisoned, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_Chambers">Rebecca Chambers</a> will come and will go get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Serum">Serum</a> for <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a>. If you weren't, head back to the first floor. Now you need to head through the double doors. Watch out for dogs and zombies that crash through the windows in the hallway that follows. Go through next the double doors, across from the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> room. Now you're back in an "L" shaped hallway. After coming through the double doors, keep on going down towards the camera. There should be a zombie around here. Kill him, and go into the door that you can unlock.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_39" class="f_other">You will be in a "U" shaped hallway with pictures. There are crows in here, but don't shoot at them because they won't hurt you, as long as you do the puzzle right.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_40" class="f_item">Change the light on the first painting so it turns orange. Now, run to the other side of the "U". Flick the lights on the first two paintings. The one with the necklace should turn purple and the other green. Now, go all the way to the end and there will be a woman (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>) wearing 3 things, colored orange, purple, and green. Hit the switch. For <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a>, you might want to go back around and place the first 3 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a> so he has enough spaces.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_41" class="f_boss f_item">After you hit the switch under the woman, the wall will raise. Go outside, grab the last <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a>, and unlock the gate. Now, if you don't have them, go to the Safe Room outside of the crow room and get to the item box. You need a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>, and all 4 of the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a>. And maybe a couple of health items, or just save it. If you want more item space, just bring the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a> out 2 at a time. Now go back and through the wall the picture opened up to. I think you'll know where this is. Anyway, head down into the crypt where you first saw the coffin. Once you're down the stairs, put all the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a> on the wall (you have to match them up), and watch the cut-scene. Shoot the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head_Prototype_1">Crimson Head Prototype 1</a> with your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>. It should only take about 5 rounds. On hard mode, you only get 1 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> for help down there. It's possible to kill him by making every bullet count and stabbing him when he falls to the ground and he'll die after he falls for the 3rd time.  After he's dead, go and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone & Metal Object</a> and some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a> (Easy/Normal).

This time, keep going straight after you come out the door and open the put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone & Metal Object</a> into the indentation to open the gate to the outside. You may put away the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>, you won't be needing it for a little while. Make sure to get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Crest">Wind Crest</a> out of your item box.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_42" class="f_item">Go all the way down and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone & Metal Object</a> in the rightful place. A dog will jump out and chase after ya, but it's easy to avoid. When you have done that, go into the door. You're going to be in a tool shed.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_43" class="f_item">There are two doors here, and you need to go through the one down the small steps.

Watch the movie sequence, then head down the path. Make the red weather vane point West. And the blue one further down should be pointing North. Then you can go through the gate.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_44" class="f_item">Once you're through, avoid killing the crows, and also try to avoid them getting you. The area with the birds has two graves. When you're at the graveyard with the crows, put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Crest">Wind Crest</a> on the right grave. Three more <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crest_Puzzle">Crests</a> shall appear. Take all of them and examine all 3 and press the switches on their backs.  Now put them all on the left grave, and you get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>! After that, go through the gate opposite of the one you entered. It'll take a minute, but keep going in the path until you reach the cabin.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_45" class="f_item">Once you're in <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Courtyard/Cabin">Lisa's Shack</a>, there should be a typewriter and a box, and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> (explore the house to find these). Be sure you get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a>, which is off a little edge by the item box. Keep it. Dump your extra stuff (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>) except your weapon, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a>. After you get knocked out by <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> comes to.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_46" class="f_item">Now go through that other door in the shed. There are 3 dogs out here. Take them out.

Go up the small stairs and go through the gate. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> to lower the water and go down the ladder, run across, and go up the other ladder. Keep going take the elevator down. Once you go down the elevator, you'll be in another part of the garden with some crows. Just run from them. Go to the other side of the waterfall and through the gate. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Herb">Red Herb</a> nearby.

<li data-id="playthrough_1_2" class="f_item">There are several things you need to take note of. Grab all the healing items in the room along with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Unprinted_Book">Red Book</a> down the stairs.

If you didn't, pay attention to them. The colors are green, red, and orange. When you light up the lantern, you should write down the color and the number of ticks on the eyeball.

If you mess up, go up the ladder and come back down. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a>, and go into the flooded double doors.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_6" class="f_item">You're now in the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. Follow the wall towards the camera until you see a cut-scene. If you saved <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a>, he will save you and be eaten by the shark. After that, run like hell until you go up a few stairs. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Control_Room_Key">Control Room Key</a> to open the door and discard it. Climb down the ladder. Walk straight after <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> climbs down. Go to his left and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Box">First Aid Kit</a>. Now go back until the camera angle changes so you can see the ladder. Go to the left of the ladder, and check the whiteboard. It will say what valve you'll need to push very shortly.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_7" class="f_other">Now, go to the ladder's right (panel in front of the glass) and try to un-flood <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. There will be a short cut-scene. After it go to the right and keeping pressing "A" until you hit the switch. Now go behind the ladder and find that switch and press it. The shudder will get stuck. Go to the valves and turn the one it mentioned on the whiteboard. Now, go back and press the switch that you first pressed after the cut-scene. Now go back and hit the switch to make the shudders come down (the one behind the ladder). Finally, hit the very first switch you hit to drain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. Now leave that specific area, and go down the right side of the hall. Down the stairs and through the door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_8" class="f_boss">Climb down and into the room with the sharks don't worry about the sharks; they can't do anything besides flop around so don't waste ammo. Keep running until you get down by <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Neptune">Neptune</a> (this big ass shark). Climb up onto the platform. Try to grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_the_Gallery">Key For The Gallery</a> in the corner. It will drop into the water when <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Neptune">Neptune</a> wakes up. Don't shoot him.

<li data-id="playthrough_1_9" class="f_item">Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_the_Gallery">Key For The Gallery</a>, then pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_Shotgun_(RE1)">Assault Shotgun</a> near the smaller shark and go back to the room before this one and go through the other gate. After entering through the gate, there will be some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum_Rounds">Magnum Rounds</a> on a box so get those and anything else that might be there. Do not use any <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum_Rounds">Magnum Rounds</a> yet. Climb up the ladder and go though the door. You'll now be in the place where you had to push the boxes into water. Head back to the gallery door (door by room 002).</li>

<li data-id="playthrough_1_11" class="f_boss f_item">Once you're in room 003, there's a bookshelf in the back. Grab the only book you can and relace it with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Unprinted_Book">Red Book</a>. Now, you have to rearrange the book order. It's pretty basic and easy, doesn't take long at all, or it shouldn't.  After that, a shelf will slide over and reveal a secret door.

Go back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main hall through the crow gallery, since that path is clear of enemies. Enter the dining room. There should be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Gemstone">Blue Gemstone</a> on the left side of the table, which is the opposite side the grandfather clock is on. Now head back upstairs, through the dining room balcony and head towards the Safe Room. There are 2 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunters</a> up here on Normal/Hard.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_2" class="f_item">Before you go down the stairs to the Safe Room, go slightly into the small corridor. Go into the one next to you. There'll be an eagle statue on the wall that moves. Turn off the lights. Then, grab the ammo and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> on the shelf by the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_Gemstone">Yellow Gemstone</a>. Now, push the dressers so that they are underneath the animal heads that hold the gems you must get. Be sure to hear a "chink" type sound so that the eagle stops moving, and hug the wall to one of the dressers, climb up and get the gem. Repeat the process for the other gem. Once you have both <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Gemstone">Red Gemstone</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_Gemstone">Yellow Gemstone</a>, go into the Safe Room.

<li data-id="playthrough_2_3" class="f_item">Now there's a door for you to enter. It's on the shorter hall of the "F".

Now head back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main room and go and unlock the door you haven't been to on the main floor.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_4" class="f_item">Nothing in the first room except for <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbons</a> in a drawer (Easy/Normal).

After that, grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jewelry_Box_(RE1)">Jewelry Box</a>. There's also a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Herb">Blue Herb</a> planter in here. Now combine your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Gemstone">Red Gemstone</a> with it to get it open. Now, there's a slight puzzle. Kinda hard to explain without using pictures, but I can try anyway. There are 5 pieces. The third (meaning third down) piece should be put on the bottom right side. The top piece goes in the upper left corner (you'll have to rotate if needed for any pieces). The fourth piece (at the beginning, make sure to remember what order they were in) goes in between the others. The last goes on the right side that's open, and you can figure out the rest. Might take a minute though, sometimes it doesn't quite fit, but that is the right way.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_5" class="f_item">When you're done, you'll have a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Coin">Brooch</a>. Examine it, and it'll turn into the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Emblem_Key">Emblem Key</a>, used only for one door. Now, head back through the crow gallery. Go into the door you can unlock with your new key, the Study. In the Study, you will hear a scream. Time to save <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_Chambers">Rebecca Chambers</a>! Trust me, it's for the best, don't let her die. She's upstairs in the small library where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_Whistle">Dog Whistle</a>, being attacked by a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a>. Hurry. After you save her, go back down to the study.

<li data-id="playthrough_2_6" class="f_item">Leave the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a> in an item box if you can (head into the East Safe Room).

Go all of the way down, all the way, and you'll come to a door. You'll use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Key">Helmet Key</a> to unlock it. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a> (2 on Easy, but none on Hard). Now keep going and something will come to you.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_7" class="f_boss f_item">It's <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> the snake. Keep running and climb down the ladder. Find the row of books that you can go behind. <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> will follow you in one end, and you come out the other. Then, you just blast its tail until it dies. If you go up the ladder <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> won't be able to hit you. You'll see the pattern you need to go in, and it's actually pretty easy to hit its head a few times. When it's dead, it'll knock the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Book_Vol._2">Last Book Vol.2</a> off of the bookshelf. Pick it up, examine it, and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Wolf">Medal Of Wolf</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_8" class="f_item">Go to the Safe Room where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a>.

There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> near the Safe Room door. Blast it, and there is another upstairs if you're playing on Normal/Hard. Then head up stairs, and turn left, and walk until you turn the corner. Keep going and enter the door. Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> if ya need them, but keep in mind you'll need spaces open, at least 2. Go through the next door. Push the statue you see in the opening to the left.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_9" class="f_item">The walls will close in on you, but as long as the statue's there you'll be fine. Now go out to where the statue was. Keep going into the other passage. There will be a switch that you need to push at the end of the room to get the walls to come back. Push it, and run back to the other statue, and push it to the left (you'll see the indentation where it needs to go). After that's done, go in where it opened up. There's a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Grenade_(RE1)">Flash Grenade</a> (Easy, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> on Normal) on a cabinet.

Now check out the grave and head down into it.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_10" class="f_item">As soon as you're down there, there will be three spiders (Normal/Hard, 2 on Easy). Just run. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a> from the boxes, and head through the door. Kill the zombies lurking around. There will also be a couple items here, so pick em up if ya want. Find the switch that you have to activate for the elevator. After that, you can get out of there. You'll be in a kitchen when you head through the exit door. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>, and there will be a crawling zombie. Run towards the screen, and find the elevator. Call it up, and when it gets there head in and down.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_11" class="f_item">When you come out, there will be two zombies; one on each side, come toward the camera first though, it's easier. There'll be <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> here as well. Now go to the other side of the elevator and go in the room. Inside is a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Battery_(RE1_remake)">Battery</a>, a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Grenade_(RE1)">Flash Grenade</a>, and some ammo. Leave through the door by this room. If you ran out of spaces, head out and through the other door and find your way back to the Safe Room. Once you have everything, be sure to take the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> with you, and deposit the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Eagle">Medal Of Eagle</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/MO_Disk_(RE1)">MO Disk</a> if you haven't already.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_12" class="f_item">Now, you gotta travel all the way back to where the waterfall lies. Watch out for dogs. Once you're there, head down and find the elevator, and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Battery_(RE1_remake)">Battery</a> in it and use it. You'll come to a familiar area. Go and use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> to fill up the pool. Now go back and use the elevator to go down.

After you do, use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> on the wall. The statue will be pushed out. Now push it onto the round platform and it will turn 90 degrees. Now you have to push it off, then back on again to get it facing the proper way. Move it off, then push it into the indentation, by the other statue. You'll get the Cylinder. Now, head all the way back to where the elevator is (you'll need to grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Flamethrower_(RE1)"> Flamethrower</a> on the way to unlock to door). Find the control panel, get the Shaft. Combine it with the Cylinder. Put the combined item back into the panel and press 4231. Now head over and start up the elevator, and watch the scene.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_4" class="f_item">Use the item box to put away the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> and whatever big weapon you have.

Keep going and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a> appears in the direction you head first, so when you have the choice of which way, start going left but then go right. When the camera changes, make sure to be able to see a switch set into the wall.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_5" class="f_other">Right now, ignore it. Keep going until you see a door; go through it. Climb the pile of boxes in the corner for some ammo. Go back down, and find the box and push it onto the metal box lift. Hit the switch and go back to the room with the item box, before <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>. If you see <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a> coming, go the other way.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_6" class="f_item">Watch the cut-scene. Get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a> from the item box and go down the ladder. There's also some ammo on Easy by the ladder. Now push the box into the crusher.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_7" class="f_item">After you crush it, jump down and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Flamethrower">Broken Flamethrower</a>. Go back to the place with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>, and now it's time for you to pull the lever. Find the stairs and go down them, and find the door with the hooks by them quickly. Place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Flamethrower">Broken Flamethrower</a> there to unlock the door and leave. Go through the water quickly while avoiding snakes. After you come out of the water, pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jewelry_Box_(RE1)">Jewelry Box</a>. Examine it to find the frame for the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a>. There is also a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> on the bed on Easy mode. Climb up the ladder and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> if you got poisoned. Now combine the frame with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a>. Remember the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone & Metal Object</a> (you used it to get outside)? Time to get it back. Go all the way back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion</a> and take it. There will be more zombies out in the area where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a> so avoid them since you won't be coming back here.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_8" class="f_item"> Now go to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main room. There's a set of double doors underneath the stairs. Place the two <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone & Metal Objects</a> in the indentations in the doors. Go in, and there will be an item box down a little ways. Be sure to bring a couple <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a> as well as the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Eagle">Medal Of Eagle</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Wolf">Medal Of Wolf</a>. Lastly, now would be an ideal time to save. Should you feel it necessary, there is a typewriter at the top of the stairs.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_3_9" class="f_boss f_item">Go all the way, until you come to a ladder and go down it. Watch. You'll meet up with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Albert_Wesker">Albert Wesker</a>. He'll shoot <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a> to distract her, but he won't last very long. She's invincible, but all you need to do is push the 4 stone pillars off the edges to end this. After you're done the metal mesh will open back up, and you're going to go outside. Head to the fountain and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Wolf">Medal Of Wolf</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Eagle">Medal Of Eagle</a> on the sides of the pool, and head down.

When you leave the elevator walk around and you'll find a door that "won't open unless in first class emergency." But for now, continue past the door and head down the ladder and you'll enter a small room with a typewriter and an item box. Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbons</a> and save your game if you wish. Once you're done, equip yourself with you <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_(remake)">Handgun</a> for now; more zombies await your arrival.

<li data-id="playthrough_4_2" class="f_item">Go through the door and enter the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arklay_Laboratory">Laboratory</a>.

There will be a couple more zombies one to <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield's</a> left and one heading straight towards him. Kill both of zombies and make sure they're either decapitated or incinerated, because you'll be in a situation later on where you'll be glad you won't have <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head">Crimson Heads</a> lurking in the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arklay_Laboratory">Laboratory B3F</a>. After you've taken care of the zombies enter the door to the right of the long flight of stairs. You'll find a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Box">First Aid Kit</a> lying on the ground with a double <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a>. Head through the door on the immediate left and you'll enter a room, tinted with blue light. The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/X-Ray_of_CLARK">X-Ray Of Clark</a> is glittering on the boxes across from the entrance.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_4_3" class="f_item">Move farther into the room, and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> finds another film on the left side, the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/X-Ray_of_GAIL">X-Ray Of Gail</a>. When you pick up this item, you'll notice a diagram of the human organs, all named for your convenience. The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Researcher%27s_Letter">Researcher's Letter</a> is on the desk to the right. The western wall is where the X-Rays go, and there are two open spaces on the light board.</li>

If you get them backwards, you can easily switch them while they are on display. Return to the entrance and flip the switch on the wall. The red light reveals highlighted organs on the X-Rays. If you placed them correctly, you'll see the organs highlighted in this order: the Colon, the Esophagus, the Liver, and then the Lungs. If you take the first letter of each word, you spell "<B>CELL</B>." Keep this in mind as you continue.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_4_5" class="f_item">Head back out into the central square and into the double doors on the upper-northeast corner of the square.

Once you've unlocked the doors, log off and head back to the central square area and back to the hallway with the X-Ray room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_4_6" class="f_item">You'll notice at the very end of the hallway there's an electronically locked door that has three levers on the right side.

The door leads to the jail cell where your friend <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill Valentine</a> is waiting to be rescued. You don't need to use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/MO_Disk_(RE1)">MO Disks</a> in order to beat the game, but if you want the best possible ending, then you'll need to save <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill Valentine</a>.  Enter the room you've just unlocked on the right side of the hallway. You'll encounter a naked zombie (Normal/Hard). Kill it and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Slide_Filter">Slide Filter</a> and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fax">FAX File</a>. There is also an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbon</a> in the sink on Easy.

In this T-shaped hallway, make sure you kill the naked zombies (Normal/Hard), especially the one on your right before you continue. On the north side of the hallway you'll find a large elevator that doesn't work because it needs to be powered up. On the south side of the corridor, you'll see a large door that leads to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Training_School/Boiler_room">Boiler Room</a> where you'll surely find <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chimera">Chimeras</a> everywhere.

Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Launcher_(RE1)">Rocket Launcher</a> and fire rockets at the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrant_(T-002_Model)">Tyrant</a> until you catch him off-guard. If you're playing on Hard Difficulty or Real Survival, the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrant_(T-002_Model)">Tyrant</a> will always block the first rocket and you will need to fire a second one at it. The rocket will destroy the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrant_(T-002_Model)">Tyrant</a> and the game is finally over. Well done!</li>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ FAQ ]</font></h3>
<br>
<font color="red">~</font> The layout and framework of this guide was based on my <a href="https://adore33.github.io/REHD-Jill-Checklist/">Resident Evil: HD Remake - Jill Checklist</a>.<br>
<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The collective data and information was based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> - <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil/Walkthrough"> Resident Evil: HD Remaster Wiki Guide.</a>
I fixed a few spelling errors and re-worded a few things.  In general though it is a straight conversion from guide to checklist.
Any other information came from the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Resident_Evil">Resident Evil Wiki.</a><p></p>

<font color="red">~</font> Again, this is <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> work.
This is simply another form of the same information that I converted or added to for the purposes of the Checklist.
So any thanks you have please direct towards <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty.</a>
I just find these Checklists nice to use.  I as well wanted to learn how to make and edit them.
I tried to stick close to <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> Guide with this Checklist.  You can use either one or both together.
His includes picture references that are useful.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> This Checklist is best viewed on a PC browser.
If using your phone, please rotate your phone to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCU2aKJxxmAJzsQlrcG8gYMfLioAYnod/view?usp=sharing">Landscape Orientation</a> for best viewing.
My HTML code changes or additions were all done by hand in Notepad.
I tried my best to get the formatting and placement to look good on monitors and phones.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> Any errors, typos, adjustments and improvements that need to be addressed in the Checklist.
You can drop me an email and I will look into it.
<a href="mailto:penumbra1979@comcast.net?subject=White_Day_Checklist_Modifications">Send Email.</a>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ Is This A Guide Or Walkthrough? ]</font></h3>
<br>
<font color="red">~</font> Not exactly.  This Checklist will help you obtain most <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Items</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_creatures">Boss</a> kills needed to beat the game.
Other <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Items</a> that are not listed you will obtain natrually as you progress and search.  Like <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazines</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_files">Files</a>.
So search rooms as you would without this Checklist.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> This Checklist will lead you to the good ending and assumes you are playing on Normal difficulty.
If this is your first time playing <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/1/us/">Resident Evil: HD Remake</a>.  You may want to consider playing on "Easy" mode first to give you a feel for the game,
as some may find it very difficult.  Then with some familiarity and desire to 100% the game.
Go back through on "Normal" mode and use this Checklist to help.  You can still use this Checklist for "Easy" mode, just not everything will apply.
Here is a breakdown of the difficulty modes as they are not traditionally labeled...<P></P>

<font color="red">~ </font>Walking - Very Easy<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Hiking - Easy<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Mountain - Normal<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Hard - Unlocked<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Real Survival - Unlocked<BR>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How To Use This Checklist ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font>The best way is to use it as a reference for your first playthrough.  It can be easy to walk into a Boss encounter in some situations.  Before you leave an area make sure you didn't miss anything important for progression.
Reference it then so you don't ruin the game for yourself on your first playthrough.<P></P>
<font color="red">~</font> The sorting method for the Checklist may need some adjustments to be the most effective and efficient.
So please, as stated above, drop me an email if it can be improved.  It isn't designed for a speedrun or anything.
It is setup based on ( <font color="red">Areas > Buildings > Floors > Rooms </font> ) you have access to.
There is a certain degree of backtracking needed in Resident Evil regardless.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The three buttons you see on the ( <font color="red">Playthrough</font> ) page.
Clicking them so the Eye Symbol is crossed out will hide that category in the Checklist.
Helpful to simplify the Checklist if you only need one category visible.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The ( <font color="red">Other</font> ) category pertains to directions or explanations.  Usually not directly with obtaining an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Item</a> or killing a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_creatures">Boss</a>.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> Use the Searchbar provided within the Checklist to search for keywords.
Such as <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_Chambers">Rebecca</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>, etc. to quickly filter the Checklist.<p></p>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Does The Checklist Status Get Saved? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> The Checklist is saved to your browser on your PC or your phone's local history storage.
Be careful when clearing your browser's cache as it will reset your saved progress in the Checklist.

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Can I Save For Multiple Characters? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> Go to ( <font color="red">Options</font> ) tab at the top of this page.  In the ( <font color="red">Profile Management</font> ) section, Add or Edit profiles.

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Can I Change The Background Color? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> I set it to Black ( <font color="red">Darkly Theme</font> ) by default to be easier on the eyes and to go with the asthetic of this Checklist.
If you prefer to be blinded by white go to ( <font color="red">Options</font> ) tab at the top of this page.
In the ( <font color="red">Theme Selection</font> ) section, change it to ( <font color="red">Standard Theme</font> ) or pick any other theme you would like.
